So for todays class we are going to give you all a chance to get a bit more inovlved with some of the subjects we've discussed.  First, we are going to spend some time digging into the mechanics of how to get a blog post up on the class website and second, we will re-visit one of the excercises we did during the bootcamp to get some more familiarity with pulling data into R and doing some quicky analysis.

## Blog Posts via Git and Github 

For the first hands-on each of you will write up a short blog post.  Provide some basic information about yourself, your research/work interests, and why you decided to take the bootcamp and continue on with this class.

Refer to the [Course Introduction and Blog Posts with R Markdown](http://scicomp2014.edc.uri.edu/posts/2014-01-27-Hollister.html) post to help get you started.  Adam and I will be available to help answer quesitons.

## Basic R 

The second hands on we will re-visit the [Data Strucutre and File I/O Exercise](https://github.com/iglpdc/2014-01-13-uri/blob/gh-pages/rLessons/Data.md#data-subsetting-and-manipulation) from the bootcamp.  You may either do this exercise via RStudio or with RCmdr.  But make sure to save both in the form of a .R script.

Lastly, so as not to completely repeat ourselves, and if you have the time try the following:

1. Conduct a t-test on any data (and category) of your choosing.
2. Create a plot of your choosing on the same data you used in for the t-test.
